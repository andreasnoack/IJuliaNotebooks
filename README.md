# IJuliaNotebooks

#### My collection of IJulia notebooks

You can either click a notebook and watch a static version or run them interactively by going to [http://juliabox.com] and synchronize your account with this site. The steps are the following

- Go to juliabox.com and login with you preffered method (Google, Github)
- Accept the terms of use
- Click the `Sync` tab and add [https://github.com/andreasnoack/IJuliaNotebooks] in the "Git Repositories" section and click first `plus` and then `sync`.
- Click the `Jupyter` tab. Now a new folder named `IJuliaNotebooks` should be visible (the name might be truncated).
- Open the `Faraday.ipynb` notebook, click `Cell > Run All`. (The first time you run a program, it might be slow.)

It is of course also possible just to download and run the notebook locally on a machine with a Julia installation.
